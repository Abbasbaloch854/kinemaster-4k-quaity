    <h2>Why Choose 4K Export?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Superior Quality:</strong> 4K resolution provides four times the pixels of Full HD, ensuring every detail of your video is sharp and vibrant. This is particularly useful for professional projects, where image quality is paramount.</li>
        <li><strong>Future-Proofing:</strong> As more devices and platforms support 4K, exporting in this resolution ensures your content remains relevant and looks great on any screen.</li>
        <li><strong>Professional Edge:</strong> High-resolution videos are a staple in the professional world. Whether you're creating content for clients or your own projects, 4K export can significantly enhance the perceived quality of your work.</li>

    <h2>Steps to Export in 4K Using KineMaster</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Open Your Project:</strong> Start KineMaster and open the project you wish to export.</li>
        <li><strong>Access Export Settings:</strong> Tap the export button, usually represented by a share icon or an arrow pointing up.</li>
        <li><strong>Select Resolution:</strong> In the export settings, select 4K as your desired resolution.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust Bitrate:</strong> Higher bitrates generally improve video quality but also increase file size. Choose a bitrate that balances quality and file size according to your needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Export:</strong> Once you've set your resolution and bitrate, tap the export button to start the process. Depending on your device's capabilities and the project's complexity, this might take some time.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Optimal 4K Export</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device Performance:</strong> Ensure your device has sufficient processing power and storage space to handle 4K video files.</li>
        <li><strong>Lighting and Camera Quality:</strong> To fully benefit from 4K resolution, use high-quality footage. Good lighting and a capable camera can make a significant difference.</li>
        <li><strong>Editing Precision:</strong> Pay attention to fine details during editing, as 4K's clarity will make any imperfections more noticeable.</li>
